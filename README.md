# node-gallery-module

Fancy image gallery module created using node,express and the MixItUp plugin to demonstrate visualisation of a data set containing images and meta data.

This was an exploration into creating a data set agnostic module which could be configred to display a data set consisting of images an metadata by mapping json object properties and constructing compatible objects from this mapping at runtime. 

It is a simple project but shows all the features that were required by the assignment spec including basic theming.

Developed for Advanced Web Publishing Apps module and deployed on Heroku
